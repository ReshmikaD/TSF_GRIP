# Face-Mask-Detector

A real-time face mask detector using Tensorflow and OpenCV

# Introduction 

This REAL TIME FACE MASK DETECTOR uses live stream camera  to capture input and helps to classify if a person is wearing a face mask or not.
The objective of this project is to train a deep convolutional neural network on images collected from the data to check whether a person is using a mask.

# Classification Accuracy

We can see that our model has an accuracy of 95.65% to predict mask or without mask from faces.

# Required Libraries:

    Keras
    OpenCV
    Numpy
    Tensorflow
    imutils
    Matplotlib
    Scikit-Learn
